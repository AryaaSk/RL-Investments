# RL Investments
## I don't know if there is any copyright or law that prevents me from using the RL Insider data, so I'm not going to release this app on the app store.

An app which helps you track your investments in the popular game Rocket League. There is an active trading scene in this game with the primary currency being credits, many people make investments and try and sell later on when the price of the item has gone up in price.

To get accurate pricing details, most people use the website: https://rl.insider.gg. I have also used this website to gather pricing information.

### Investments
The app just lets you add investments, including the item itself, the colour, the price it was bought for, and the platform it was bought on. It then will output the profit/loss if you sell the item right now.\
There is also a total button if you want to find out the complete profit/loss if you sell everything that you have added in the app.

### Cross Platform
There is also a cross-platform section, which allows you to transfer credits from one platform to another, since it is not directly possible due to differing terms and condition on each platform. For example if you were transferring credits from Xbox -> PC, you could buy an item for X amount of credits on xbox, and sell it for Y amount of credits on pc. The app tries and gives you the best conversion rate so you lose as little credits as possible.

### Prices
This is just a simple list of all the items and their respective prices.

Here are some previews:
